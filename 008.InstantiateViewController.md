# InstantiateViewController

---
1. With this method, a Viewcontroller is created and presented / shown / pushed.
2. While using this method, Unwrapping is compulsary!!!
3. By creating a that vc, variables can be transferred.
---
    override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
        if let vc = storyboard?.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "DetailVC") as? DetailViewController {
            vc.selectedImage = pictures[indexPath.row]
            vc.selectedImageNumber = indexPath.row + 1
            vc.totalNumberOfImages = pictures.count
            navigationController?.pushViewController(vc, animated: true)
        }
    }

> Defining the StoryBoard

            let mainSB = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: Bundle.main)
            let customVC = mainSB.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "customVC")
            

            customVC.modalPresentationStyle = .fullScreen //or .overFullScreen for transparency
            //show(customVC, sender: nil)
            present(customVC, animated: true)

## This is also possible (Easier)

    let vc = DetailViewController()
    vc.detailItem = petitions[indexPath.row]
    navigationController?.pushViewController(vc, animated: true)
