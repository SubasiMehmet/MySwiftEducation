//        Every UIView has a set of anchors that define its layouts rules. The most important ones are widthAnchor, heightAnchor, topAnchor, bottomAnchor, leftAnchor, rightAnchor, leadingAnchor, trailingAnchor, centerXAnchor, and centerYAnchor.
//
//        Most of those should be self-explanatory, but itâ€™s worth clarifying the difference between leftAnchor, rightAnchor, leadingAnchor, and trailingAnchor.
//        For me, left and leading are the same, and right and trailing are the same too.
//        MARK: leftAnchor = leadingAnchor  &  rightAnchor = trailingAnchor
